### 🖥️ Backend Overview of Ikigai Application

#### **🔍 What is the Backend?**
The **backend** of the Ikigai application is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It is responsible for handling data, managing user accounts, and connecting to the database.

#### **⚙️ Technologies Used:**
- **Node.js**: A program that runs JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: A tool that helps us build web apps quickly using Node.js.
- **MySQL**: A database where we store user information like emails and passwords.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A way to keep users logged in securely.
- **bcryptjs**: A tool that makes passwords safe by changing them into a code before saving.

#### **⭐ Main Features:**
1. **🔑 User Login and Registration**: Users can create an account and log in. Their passwords are saved safely using **bcryptjs**, and **JWT tokens** are used to keep users logged in.
2. **🔗 Database Connection**: The backend connects to **MySQL** to store and get user information.
3. **📡 API Endpoints**: 
   - `/login`: Used for logging in and getting a **JWT token**.
   - `/register`: Used for creating a new user account.
4. **💾 Storing Data**: The backend stores user details like **username**, **email**, and **password** in the database.

#### **🔄 How It Works:**
- The **frontend** (what users see) sends requests to the backend using the **internet**.
- The backend processes the requests, talks to the database, and sends back the right information.
- It keeps **user data safe** by encrypting passwords and using **JWT** for security.

#### **🔐 Conclusion:**
The backend is important because it makes sure users can safely log in, create accounts, and use the app, while keeping their information secure. 🔒
